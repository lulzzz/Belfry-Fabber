This is a design for a home-built plastic extrusion 3D printer.  It's
loosely based on the CupCake CNC 3D printer from MakerBot, using the
same Gen3 electronics.  It adds the following features compared to
those of the CupCake CNC:

  * 165 x 175 x 165mm build area.
  * Fast warmup heated build platform.
  * LCD and keypad for info display, motion and configuration.
  * Computer-free builds from SD Card.
  * Smooth Z-axis motion using an ACME threaded rod and sliders.
  * No timing belt needed for the Z axis.
  * Uses non-metric parts, for those of us stuck in a non-metric country.
